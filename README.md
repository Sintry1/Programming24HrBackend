# Programming-3rd-Sem-24hr-frontend

Code for the backend of my 24hr Programming Exam in Semester 3.

Utterly unfinished and the important endpoints still don't work as of 45 minutes before handin. 

Working on it in the festive break to hopefully come back to the exam with a fully working product.
